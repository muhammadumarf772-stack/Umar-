    <h1>About This Website</h1>

    <p>
        This website was created for people who want to learn <strong>real online skills</strong> and
        explore honest ways to earn money online — without confusion, fake promises, or complicated jargon.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like many beginners, I once felt overwhelmed by the internet. Too many methods, too many gurus,
        and too much unrealistic hype. This space exists to make things <strong>clear, practical, and human</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="soft-box">
        <p>
            🌱 Here, the focus is simple: <strong>learn a skill first, grow slowly, and earn with confidence</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>

        I started this website to share what I learn along the way, in a way that feels
        honest, relatable, and achievable. No pressure, no exaggeration — just real progress.
